# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bug: Classes Not Applied After Build
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes are correctly defined in the source code but fail to apply after the build process. The issue is particularly strange because it only occurs under certain, hard-to-replicate circumstances and is not immediately obvious.

## Bug Description
The primary problem is that Tailwind CSS classes, despite being properly imported and used in the component's JavaScript code, do not render visually on the webpage after the build process (e.g., using `npm run build` or similar).  The classes seem to be completely ignored, resulting in default styling or no styling at all.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Observe that the Tailwind CSS classes are not applied in the resulting HTML file.

## Solution
The solution often involves investigating the build process itself and ensuring that the Tailwind CSS directives are correctly processed during the compilation stage.  This may involve checking the configuration of Webpack, Rollup, or other bundlers to make sure they handle Tailwind correctly.
